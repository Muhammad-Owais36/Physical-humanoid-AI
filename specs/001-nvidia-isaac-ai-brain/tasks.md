**Feature**: 001-nvidia-isaac-ai-brain
**Generated**: 2025-12-15
**Spec**: specs/001-nvidia-isaac-ai-brain/spec.md
**Plan**: specs/001-nvidia-isaac-ai-brain/plan.md

## Implementation Strategy

This plan implements a research paper on AI-Robot Brain development using NVIDIA Isaac™, focusing on advanced perception, photorealistic simulation, and bipedal humanoid navigation. The approach follows the curriculum structure with 3 chapters and 2-3 case studies, targeting robotics engineers, AI researchers, and simulation developers.

**MVP Scope**: Complete Chapter 1 (Introduction to AI-Robot Brain and Humanoid Simulation) with basic case study to demonstrate the research paper format and citation methodology.

## Dependencies

- User Story 1 (P1) must be completed before User Story 2 (P2)
- User Story 2 (P2) must be completed before User Story 3 (P3)
- Foundational research and setup tasks must be completed before any user story phases

## Parallel Execution Opportunities

- Chapter 2 and Case Study 2 can be developed in parallel after Chapter 1 is complete
- Technical concept explanations can be developed in parallel with case studies
- Reference collection can happen in parallel with chapter writing
