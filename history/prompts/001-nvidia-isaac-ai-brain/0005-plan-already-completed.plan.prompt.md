## Prompt

$ARGUMENTS

## Response snapshot

Plan already exists and implementation is complete for the AI-Robot Brain Development Research Paper using NVIDIA Isaac™. The feature specification, implementation plan, research findings, data model, contracts, and all tasks have been completed. Three comprehensive chapters and case studies have been created, meeting all requirements including 3000-5000 words of content, 6+ peer-reviewed sources in APA format, and coverage of NVIDIA Isaac ecosystem, photorealistic simulation, VSLAM, and bipedal navigation.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Confirmed plan completion and implementation status
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: All planning and implementation artifacts for NVIDIA Isaac AI-Robot Brain feature
- 🔁 Next prompts: none needed - feature is complete
- 🧠 Reflection: Feature development lifecycle completed successfully from spec to implementation

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Deploy documentation or begin next feature
