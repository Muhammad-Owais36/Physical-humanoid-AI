# Docusaurus Book Architecture Specification

## 1. Introduction

This specification defines the architecture for a comprehensive Docusaurus-based book on AI/Spec-driven development. The book will serve as both a reference guide and tutorial for creating AI-powered documentation systems using the Spec-Driven Development (SDD) methodology.

## 2. Goals and Objectives

### Primary Goals
- Create a comprehensive guide to AI/Spec-driven book development using Docusaurus
- Establish best practices for structuring technical documentation
- Provide practical examples and implementation strategies
- Demonstrate integration of AI tools with documentation workflows

### Secondary Goals
- Document the architecture and design decisions for future reference
- Create reusable templates and patterns for similar projects
- Establish quality standards and validation procedures

## 3. Scope

### In Scope
- Docusaurus configuration and customization
- Book information architecture and navigation structure
- Content development strategy and writing guidelines
- Integration with AI tools and automation
- Cross-module consistency rules
- Versioning and maintenance strategies

### Out of Scope
- Detailed implementation of individual book chapters (beyond structural examples)
- External API integrations beyond Docusaurus standard features
- Deployment infrastructure specifics

## 4. Target Audience

- Technical writers and documentation engineers
- AI/ML engineers working with documentation systems
- Software developers creating technical documentation
- Product managers overseeing documentation projects

## 5. Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- Book must be organized in a logical, hierarchical structure
