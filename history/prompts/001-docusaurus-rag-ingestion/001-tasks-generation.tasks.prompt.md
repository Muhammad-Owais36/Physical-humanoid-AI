## Prompt

Run /sp.tasks to generate implementation tasks for the Docusaurus RAG vector ingestion pipeline

## Response snapshot

Generated comprehensive implementation tasks for the Docusaurus RAG vector ingestion pipeline based on the feature specification, implementation plan, research findings, data model, and quickstart guide. The tasks are organized by user story priority (P1, P2, P3) with proper dependencies and parallel execution opportunities identified. The tasks follow the required checklist format with sequential IDs, story labels, and specific file paths.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created complete task breakdown for Docusaurus RAG ingestion pipeline implementation with 38 specific tasks organized across 6 phases
- 🧪 Tests: No tests generated (not requested in spec)
- 📁 Files: Generated C:/Users/MT/Desktop/FARHEEN giaic/specs/001-docusaurus-rag-ingestion/tasks.md with 38 implementation tasks
- 🔁 Next prompts: Implementation of individual tasks can now proceed
- 🧠 Reflection: Tasks are properly organized by user story priority and follow the required format with proper dependencies

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Begin implementation of Phase 1 setup tasks
