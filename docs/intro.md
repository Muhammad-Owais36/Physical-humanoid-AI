# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the comprehensive guide on **Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics: AI Systems in the Physical World**. This documentation covers the integration of artificial intelligence with physical robotic systems, focusing on humanoid robots that operate in real-world environments.

## Overview

This guide is structured into four core modules that build upon each other to create a complete understanding of AI-driven humanoid robotics:

1. **Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)** - Middleware for robot control
2. **Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)** - Physics simulation and environment building
3. **Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)** - Advanced perception and training
4. **Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)** - Integrating LLMs with robotics for cognitive planning

## Target Audience

This documentation is designed for:
- Robotics students and developers
- AI researchers working with physical systems
- Engineers implementing humanoid control systems
- Anyone interested in the intersection of AI and robotics

## Prerequisites

- Basic programming knowledge (Python preferred)
- Understanding of robotics concepts
- Familiarity with Linux development environments
- Knowledge of machine learning fundamentals (for later modules)

## Getting Started

Begin with Module 1 to understand the foundational ROS 2 communication architecture, then progress through each module sequentially to build a comprehensive understanding of the complete system.
